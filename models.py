'''
models
defines sql alchemy data models
also contains the definition for the room class used to keep track of socket.io rooms

Just a sidenote, using SQLAlchemy is a pain. If you want to go above and beyond, 
do this whole project in Node.js + Express and use Prisma instead, 
Prisma docs also looks so much better in comparison

or use SQLite, if you're not into fancy ORMs (but be mindful of Injection attacks :) )
